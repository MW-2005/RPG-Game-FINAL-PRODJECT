  coneversation with ???

also how woold i subtract the price from the original amount of money

 Instead of asking if they want to go to shop 1 or 2
 Ask first --> If they want to visit the clothing
   if yes, then go to clothing shop
   else, do nothing
 Ask second --> if they want to visit the pet shop
   if yes, then go to pet shop
   else, do nothing



do i have to make the price of whwt they are buying into a variable

no, you don't have to, but the amount you subtract depends on their selection

for example, if they select the dog (response == "D"), you subtract 150 (money = money-150)
